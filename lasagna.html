    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty and comforting classic lasagna is made with layers of rich, meaty tomato sauce, creamy béchamel
        (or ricotta mixture), and tender lasagna noodles, all topped with a golden, bubbly layer of melted mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        The meat sauce is simmered with garlic, onions, crushed tomatoes, and Italian herbs for a deep, savory flavor.
        Each bite delivers a perfect balance of textures—from the soft noodles and gooey cheese to the robust sauce.
        It's baked to perfection, making it an ideal dish for family dinners, holidays, or when you're craving something warm and satisfying.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>

        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (or half beef, half Italian sausage)</li>
            
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
        <li>1 jar (24 oz) marinara or pasta sauce (or homemade)</li>
            
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese)</liL>
            
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            
        <li>1 egg</li>
            
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            
        <li> 1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
            
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
    <li> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).    </li>

    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles in salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>

    <li>Prepare the meat sauce: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and garlic, sauté until soft. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>

    <li>Stir in the marinara sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10–15 minutes.</li>

    <li>Mix the cheese filling: In a bowl, combine ricotta, egg, and half the Parmesan. Mix until smooth.    </li>

    <li>Assemble the lasagna: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce. Add a layer of noodles. Spread some cheese mixture over noodles, then meat sauce, then sprinkle mozzarella. Repeat layers, ending with sauce and mozzarella on top. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan.</li>

    <li>Cover with foil (optional: lightly grease the foil so it doesn’t stick to the cheese).</li>
    
    <li>Bake for 25 minutes covered, then uncover and bake an additional 15–20 minutes until bubbly and golden.</li>
    
    <li>Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
